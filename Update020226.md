how would we do minification and protection again ? 
which ps1 file ? or does it need to update to protect the index.html

Thought for <1s

Let me search for PowerShell scripts in your directory to find the minification and protection scripts:

5 results
Now let me check the main protection script to see what it does:

Analyzed
protect.ps1#L1-79
Great! I found the protection script. Now let me also check if there's an 
AggProtect.ps1
 that might handle all files:

Analyzed
AggProtect.ps1#L1-83
Perfect! Now let me check the restore script too:

Analyzed
restore.ps1#L1-11
Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. Let me explain your minification and protection workflow:

🔒 Minification & Protection Guide
You have 3 PowerShell scripts for protecting your 
index.html
:

1. 📄 
protect.ps1
 - Normal Protection (Recommended)
What it does: Minifies HTML & CSS, keeps JS readable for animations
When to use: Regular use, before deploying to GitHub
How to run:
powershell
.\protect.ps1
Features:

✅ Creates 
index.html.bak
 backup automatically
✅ Minifies HTML & CSS
⚠️ Keeps JavaScript readable (minifyJS: false) to preserve animations
✅ Preserves header comments
2. ⚡ 
AggProtect.ps1
 - Aggressive Protection
What it does: Full minification including JavaScript
When to use: Maximum compression (use with caution!)
How to run:
powershell
.\AggProtect.ps1
Features:

✅ Auto-restores from backup first if it exists
✅ Minifies everything including JavaScript (minifyJS: true)
⚠️ Warning: May break animations! Test thoroughly after use
3. 🔄 
restore.ps1
 - Restore Original
What it does: Restores from backup
When to use: When you need to edit 
index.html
 again
How to run:
powershell
.\restore.ps1
Features:

✅ Restores 
index.html.bak
 → 
index.html
✅ Safe way to get back to editable version
📋 Recommended Workflow
Before Each Deploy:
Make your edits to 
index.html
 (currently it's already minified)
If you need to edit: First restore
powershell
.\restore.ps1
Make your changes to the restored file
Protect before deploying:
powershell
.\protect.ps1
Commit & Push to GitHub
powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Update CV contact information"
git push
🤔 Current Status Check
Your 
index.html
 is already minified (from viewing earlier). Since you just made updates to email and LinkedIn, you should:

Option A: If deploying now ✅
Run 
.\protect.ps1
 to re-minify with your latest changes
This will update the backup and minify the current file
Option B: If making more edits 📝
Run 
.\restore.ps1
 first to get the readable version
Make your edits
Run 
.\protect.ps1
 when ready to deploy
💡 Quick Answer to Your Question:
"Which ps1 file?"

Use 
protect.ps1
 - this is the standard one that works well
"Does it need to update to protect the index.html?"

The scripts are already configured correctly for 
index.html
No updates needed! Just run 
.\protect.ps1
 when ready
Would you like me to run the protection script now, or do you want to make more edits first?

I found the issue! In the CSS.html file, the Core Competencies section has a specific inline style that's causing the problem:

html
<div class="skills-grid" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);">
This forces a 3-column grid layout, which on mobile will cause horizontal overflow and shaking. The TSE.html file doesn't have this inline style and uses the default grid which is responsive.

Similarly, let me check if there are any other elements causing the overflow. The issue is that repeat(3, 1fr) creates 3 equal columns regardless of screen size. On mobile devices, this will force the content to be too narrow and cause horizontal scrolling/shaking.

Let me fix both files by ensuring they have proper mobile-responsive CSS for the Core Competencies grid:

Perfect! Now let me also check if there are any other potential issues that could cause shaking. Let me look at the responsive CSS sections in both files to ensure they're properly handling mobile layouts:

Good! Now let me also check the container settings and ensure there are no other elements causing overflow. Let me look at the container class to make sure the padding is responsive:

Analyzed
CSS.html#L130-140
Now let me also ensure that the mobile media query doesn't have any issues. Let me check if the container padding needs adjustment for better mobile experience:

Analyzed
CSS.html#L509-540
Good! The media query is properly set up. Now let me add additional mobile-specific CSS improvements to make sure there's no horizontal overflow. Let me add a specific rule for mobile to ensure proper containment:

Now let me apply the same fix to TSE.html to ensure consistency:

Perfect! Now let me also check if ECEN.html has any similar issues and fix those too:

grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)

Good! ECEN.html doesn't have that inline style issue. Now let me apply the same mobile responsiveness improvements to ECEN.html for consistency:

Analyzed
ECEN.html#L125-924

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of all the fixes I've made:

✅ Fixed Mobile Website Shaking Issue
I've identified and fixed the horizontal overflow issue causing your website to shake on mobile devices. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

Root Cause:
CSS.html had an inline style grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) in the Core Competencies section that forced a 3-column grid even on mobile devices
Insufficient padding adjustments for mobile viewports causing content to overflow horizontally
Fixes Applied to All CV Pages (TSE.html, CSS.html, ECEN.html):
✅ Removed hardcoded 3-column grid from CSS.html's Core Competencies section
✅ Enhanced mobile responsiveness with:
Reduced container padding on mobile (40px → 20px horizontal)
Reduced section padding on mobile (25px → 15px horizontal)
Added word-wrap: break-word and overflow-wrap: break-word to prevent text overflow
Optimized timeline spacing for mobile (reduced padding-left values)
